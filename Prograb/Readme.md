This fork is important to me so I wanna talk about my fav rock band:

1. Kino. Kino was a band from the Soviet Union in the 1980s which stirred hearts with their music led by Viktor Tsoi. Their songs carried deep emotions and thoughtful lyrics, inspiring a generation hungry for change. With their energetic mix of punk, new wave, and alternative rock, Kino became a symbol of rebellion and hope. Their impact continues to resonate, leaving an unforgettable imprint on Soviet culture. I believe you don't need to understand russian to be able to feel and understand their songs' meaning and emotions.
